In 1497 a German fisherman caught a ringed pike dated 1230. This meant that the pike was more than two hundred and sixty-seven years old. But the pike cannot compete with a turtle found in 1737 and brought to the London Zoo. When the turtle was found, scientists studied it and said that it was more than a century old. Two hundred years later, the same turtle was still living in the Zoo. There are also crocodiles that live as long as turtles.
